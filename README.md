## **Task 1: Responsive Layout Implementation (Desktop & Mobile)**

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Implement the provided UI/UX design for both **Desktop** and **Mobile** views based on the shared **Figma file**.

### ðŸ“Œ Key Points to Consider

1. **Understand the Figma Design**
    - Analyze spacing, typography, colors, and component hierarchy.
    - Identify breakpoints for responsiveness (e.g., `>1024px` for desktop, `<768px` for mobile).
2. **Responsive Design Approach**
    - **Mobile-first**: Start styling for smaller screens, then scale up.
    - Use **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** for layouts.
    - Ensure consistent padding/margins across devices.
3. **UI Elements to Implement**
    - Navigation bar: Should collapse into a hamburger menu for mobile.
    - Content sections: Must reflow gracefully from multi-column (desktop) to single-column (mobile).
    - Buttons & Inputs: Should scale and maintain accessibility.
4. **Accessibility Considerations**
    - Ensure text is legible (minimum font size for mobile).
    - Proper color contrast as per WCAG guidelines.
    - Keyboard navigation should work.
5. **Testing & Verification**
    - Test in multiple devices or simulators (Chrome DevTools, Safari responsive design mode).
    - Verify that the design matches pixel-perfect alignment with Figma.
