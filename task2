## **Task 2: Nested Checkbox Component**

### 🎯 Objective

Fix the logic of the **nested checkbox component** where selecting parent categories should automatically check all children, and selecting “Select All” should select everything.

### 📌 Intended Behavior

1. **Select All Checkbox**
    - When checked: All categories (Fruits, Vegetables) and all individual items should be checked.
    - When unchecked: All should be deselected.
2. **Parent Category Checkbox (e.g., Fruits / Vegetables)**
    - When checked: All child items under that category should be checked.
    - When unchecked: All child items under that category should be unchecked.
3. **Child Checkbox (e.g., Apple, Banana, Carrot, etc.)**
    - When individual items are selected, the parent should automatically reflect the correct state:
        - **All children selected** → Parent should be checked.
        - **Some children selected** → Parent should be in an **indeterminate state**.
        - **No children selected** → Parent should be unchecked.

### 📌 Implementation Reference

- Use a **tree-like data structure** to manage nested levels.
- Keep track of **three states**: checked, unchecked, indeterminate.
- On user interaction, propagate the state both **downward** (from parent to children) and **upward** (from children to parent).

### 📌 Testing Scenarios

- Select "Select All" → Every checkbox must be checked.
- Deselect "Select All" → Every checkbox must be unchecked.
- Select "Fruits" → All fruits must be selected.
- Unselect "Fruits" → All fruits must be deselected.
- Select some fruits (e.g., Apple & Banana) → "Fruits" should be **indeterminate**.
